# THE SHRINELINKDEV (SHDE) CHANGEOVER EXPLAINNED

i-fail24 will be permanently rebranding to Shrinelinkdev (SHDE) on the 11th of August of this year.

## Why?

Well, it all has to do with the recent i-win "take this advice" drama, and I no longer feel that another "i-" channel is needed in this world. Plus, my current OC, [Fail](https://ifail2x.github.io/img/me.jpg), has been discontinued effective immediatley, which just demovtivated me to continue with this identity.

## When?

The rebrand is set to complete on August 11th of 2024, but here is the list of when everything is getting rebranded:

- February 2024: My discord server, transport channel, and TikTok accounts
- March 2024: i-fail2, my second channel, will be rebranded to ShrinelinkIRL
- April 2024: i-xita Microdesk will become Shrinelink Desktop Environment
- May 2024: My gaming channel, i-fail!osu, will rebrand to ShrinelinkGaming
- June 2024: My tech channel, i-fail-at-tech, will rebrand to ShrinelinkDev2x
- July 2024: Nothing is currently scheduled to be rebranded in this month
- August 2024: The i-fail brand will be completley phased out of reality.

That's all you need to know!
