# ObamiumTech Exposed

Hi! SHDE here! I'm not one for dropping exposure documents, but when I do, it must be for something big.
So, may I present to you, ObamiumTech exposed!

## Who is ObamiumTech?

ObamiumTech is an up and coming Croatian TechToker with over 600 followers. He makes edits using Adobe Premire Pro (and one using Sony Vegas) focusing on trends in TechTok, one of those being the Imo Mobile drama (in which he made 3 videos on).

Now that we know a little bit about him, let's continue.

## What did he do?

ObamiumTech did a lot of things to not only me, but to my friends too. Here are a few screenshots:

These screenshots say it all. ObamiumTech is a cold hearted person that calls himself a TechToker. There has also been times where he has downright gone at me for my old videos made in like 2022, when I knew way less about editing and shit like that. Why the fuck was he stalking my socials anyways? Unless... (see where I'm going with this?)

## Suspicions I have

Back in 2023, I was friends with someone called WheatleyTech/Bambus, who had similar behaviour to Obamium in every way. He was also a part of the doxxing group called TheCubanPirates, who I have had a terrible experience with in the past. (They even ended up doxxing me, but that doxx is now long since invalid).
When I asked him about Bambus, this was his reply:

![image](https://github.com/ifail2x/ifail2x.github.io/assets/126712774/71158b88-8041-4034-b061-eacbaa2d5ca6)

This is what inevitably made me link him to Wheatley/Bambus, as they are both Croatian, have similar behaviour, computer setups, and they both used an iPhone 6s. So this begs the question. What ties or relations does he have to Wheatley/Bambus?

## Conclusion

So there you have it! ObamiumTech, Shanestech if he **REALLY** didn't really have a heart or appreciated his fanbase. Hopefully this helps you understand ObamiumTech is a bad person. Now go out there, and know that all actions have consequences.

### Screenshot credit
