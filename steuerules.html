<h1 align="center">Rules for i-fail's tax fraud chat</h1>
<h4 align="center"><a href="steuerbetrug.html">&lt;- Back</a></h4>
<hr />
<p align="left">1. No impersonation: Impersonating someone you are not is guaranteed to get you banned.</p>
<p align="left">2. Be nice: Keep bad statements about another person to yourself</p>
<p align="left">3. No doxxing: Even if you don't mean it, doxxing is highly against the rules and will get you banned</p>
<p> 4. Be careful: Everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) you say in the chat is logged, even if you delete the message(s) you sent</p>
<p align="left">5. Have fun: This chat isn't just a place to chat to others and should be treated as such.</p>

<h2>Direct message rules</h2>
<h3> Direct messages are enabled in i-fail's tax fraud chat. These rules however are only to do with dming me.</h3>
<p> Please refrain from asking me anything already stated on the site or anything nonsensical. </p>
<p><strong> Simply put, it wastes my time. </strong> I'm really busy sometimes and don't usually have the time to respond to such questions.</p>
<p>If you want just small talk, try catching me when I'm active on the chat, otherwise, then try DMing me.</p>
<p>You can choose to DM me if you wish to report a video, ask about a video, or if you want to talk about something <strong>big</strong>.</p>
<p>If I feel I need to respond to you privatley to something you said in the chat, I will.</p>
