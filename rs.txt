Welcome to i-fail's tax fraud chat! It seems that you are new here, so here's a quick reminder of the rules:
1. No impersonation: Impersonating someone you are not is guaranteed to get you banned.

2. Be nice: Keep bad statements about another person to yourself

3. No doxxing: Even if you don't mean it, doxxing is highly against the rules and will get you banned

4. Be careful: Everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) you say is logged, even if you delete the message(s) you sent. 

5. Have fun: This chat isn't just a place to chat to others and should be treated as such.

If you need any help whatsoever, just DM me! I'm available from 8AM to 9PM every day!
Thanks!
